# Machine-learning-for-anaerobic-digestion
This work adopted both physiochemical information and microbial information to predict the methane yield of lab scale anaerobic digesters

The formated microbial profile, the key taxa selected based on co-occurence network, and formated physiochemical information were located in the Data folder

The script for preprocessing, data spliting, hyperparameter tuning could be found in the jupyter notebook
